In other words, they are things that can change; the interface defines the things that cannot change (without simultaneous changes to both implementation and client). Obviously, it is easier to program and modify a system if its parts make fewer assumptions about each other. On the other hand, the system may not be easier to design - it's hard to design a good interface. And there is a tension with the desire not to hide power." } + black{ bold{ " - Butler W.

For instance, if a set of size " } + white{ bold{ "n" } } + white{ " is known to be sorted, a membership test takes time " } + white{ bold{ "log n" } } + white{ " rather than " } + white{ bold{ "n" } } + white{ ". This technique is very important in the design of algorithms and the tuning of small modules. In a large system the ability to improve each part separately is usually more important.

puts white{ bold{ "Layers (or abstractions) are fundamentally leaky." } } + white{ " These leaks have consequences immediately but also have consequences over time, in two ways. One consequence is that the characteristics of the layer leak through and permeate more of the system than you realize.

puts white{ bold{ "Crowley's 2nd rule of distributed systems design" } } + black{ bold{ ": " } } + white{ bold{ "Use asynchronous techniques to couple components." } } + white{ " Synchronous coupling is impossible. If something appears synchronous, it's because some internal layer has tried to hide the asynchrony and in doing so has obscured (but definitely not hidden) a fundamental characteristic of the runtime behavior of the system." }
puts white{ bold{ "Crowley's 3rd rule of distributed systems design" } } + black{ bold{ ": " } } + white{ bold{ "Recognize and explicitly design for interacting state machines." } } + white{ " These states represent robust long-lived internal system states (rather than ad-hoc, ephemeral and undiscoverable state encoded by the value of variables in a deep call stack)." }
puts white{ bold{ "Crowley's 4th rule of distributed systems design" } } + black{ bold{ ": " } } + white{ bold{ "Failure is expected." } } + white{ " The only guaranteed way to detect failure in a distributed system is to simply decide you have waited 'too long'. This naturally means that cancellation is first-class. Some layer of the system (perhaps plumbed through to the user) will need to decide it has waited too long and cancel the interaction. Cancelling is only about reestablishing local state and reclaiming local resources - there is no way to reliably propagate that cancellation through the system. It can sometimes be useful to have a low-cost, unreliable way to attempt to propagate cancellation as a performance optimization." }
puts white{ bold{ "Crowley's 5th rule of distributed systems design" } } + black{ bold{ ": " } } + white{ bold{ "Cancellation is not rollback" } } + white{ " since it is just reclaiming local resources and state. If rollback is necessary, it needs to be an end-to-end feature." }
puts white{ bold{ "Crowley's 6th rule of distributed systems design" } } + black{ bold{ ": " } } + white{ bold{ "You can never really know the state of a distributed component." } } + white{ " As soon as you discover the state, it may have changed. When you send an operation, it may be lost in transit, it might be processed but the response is lost, or it may take some significant amount of time to process so the remote state ultimately transitions at some arbitrary time in the future. This leads to approaches like idempotent operations and the ability to robustly and efficiently rediscover remote state rather than expecting that distributed components can reliably track state in parallel. The concept of 'eventual consistency' succinctly captures many of these ideas." }
